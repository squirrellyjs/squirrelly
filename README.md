## Docs
We know nobody reads through the long and boring documentation in the ReadMe anyway, so head over to the documentation website:

[https://squirrelly.js.org](https://squirrelly.js.org)
## Tests

The default test can be run with `npm test`, and it just checks that compiling and rendering a simple template results in the correct string.
